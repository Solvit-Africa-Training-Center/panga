our configurations

1. For Theo

-- git clone https://github.com/Solvit-Africa-Training-Center/panga
-- cd panga

Then we check the branch we are in with
-- git branch
( normally *  main will be displayed)

Then put main up to date
-- git pull origin main

Then you create you branch "theo"
-- git checkout -b theo

Then you push your branch to gihub
-- git push -u origin theo

The normal work now:
git add .
git commit -m "add feature X"

BUT ATTENTION: BEFORE YOU PUSH YOUR CHANGES ALWAYS --> RESPECT THE COMMANDS ORDERS
1. You go to branch main
-- git checkout main 
2. You take the changes that are on github and add them to your local branch
-- git pull origin main
3. You go back to your local branch
-- git checkout theo
4. Add every change main to local branch "theo"
-- git merge main

NOW , AND ONLY NOW: YOU CAN PUSH
git push origin theo

2. For Arnold: same process but local branch is "arnold"

IN THE END WE DO PULL REQUESTS TO UPDATE THE MAIN BRANCH WHICH IS MAIN, WE DO IT DIRECTLY ON GITHUB THIS WAY:

On GitHub (clic only, no commandes)
GitHub has a part called PULL REQUESTS, then "Compare & Pull Request"

Choose :
base : main
compare : arnold or theo

Clic Create Pull Request
we valid and choose what to keep if any conflict appears
